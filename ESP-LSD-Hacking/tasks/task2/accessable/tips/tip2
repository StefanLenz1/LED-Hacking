The top left led (Which is the first LED) shines white. In RGB white means 0xFFFFFF however the first 0xFF appears
only in the 5th byte of the struct. Up to 260 there are a lot of zeros (Which is off in RGB) and then there are
260: 5 and 261: 6 which are the limits. Afterwards there seem to be garbage values. So the info for the
leds seem to be between "4" and "259" before and after a other variables
