since the led info only starts at the 5th byte one can get the first adress of the first led like so:
void* adress = ((char*) led_object + 4)

to add a color to it however one needs to cast adress to the type of the value or else we would only change one
byte of a multi byte type

*((Colorcode*) adress) = color;
